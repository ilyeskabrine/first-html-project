                    <p>In computing, <strong>virtualization</strong> refers to the act of creating a virtual <em>(rather than actual)</em> version of something. <br>
      This includes virtual computer hardware, virtual storage devices and virtual network resources. </p>

                    <h1>Levels of Virtualization</h1>
                    <ol>
      <li><strong>Virtualization at Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) level</strong></li>
      <p>Every machine has an instruction set. This instruction set is an interface between software and hardware. Using this instructions software can communicate with hardware.</p>
      <li><strong>Virtualization at Operating System (O.S.) level</strong></li>
      <p>In virtualization at HAL level each virtual machine is built from scratch i.e. by installing O.S., application suites, networking systems, etc.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In cloud sometimes, we need to initialize 100 Virtual machines at a single time, if we use virtualization at Hardware abstraction layer (HAL) level this can take too much time.</li>
        <li>So, to overcome this in Virtualization at Operating system level we share operating system between Virtual machines along with the hardware.</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
